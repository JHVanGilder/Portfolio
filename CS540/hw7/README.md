# Recreating LeNet-5 architecture and Training the Model to Identify Locations Featured in Given Photos
The goal of this project is to recreate the classic AI training model LeNet-5 and traning it on a set of photos in order to identify locations in user input photos
** For the sake of keeping this repository a reasonable size and without many compressed files, training data will not be included. This model takes a significant amount of time to train, so it would be impractical to upload all training data, though it can be requested via email.
