This directory contains completed projects relating to software security assigned in CS542 at UW - Madison

Some included files contain a proposed attack, attack mitigation, and explanation of each as it relates to the title. For example, in the file entitled "3.8.4 XML Injections.pdf," a proposed XML Injection attack is given along side a functional mitigation of such an attack.

Other files, such as "Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool.pdf," include demonstrations of my proficiency in Software Security related tools, such as Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool or FVP modeling tools.
